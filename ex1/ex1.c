 // Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable
// (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? -> They are the same
// What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x? -> they change independantly of each other.
