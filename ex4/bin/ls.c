// Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()`
// to run the program `/bin/ls`. Try a few variants of `exec()`, such as 
// `execl()`, `execle()`, `execv()`, and others. Why do you think there 
// are so many variants of the same basic call?

#include <stdio.h>


void main(void)

   printf("Successfully ran the ls file!\n");
