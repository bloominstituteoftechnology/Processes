// Write a program that opens the text.txt file (with the `fopen()` library call) located in this directory 
// and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor 
// returned by `fopen()`? A: Yes     What happens when they are written to the file concurrently?: It works. Mine seemed to write parent first and child second with how I implemented it.
