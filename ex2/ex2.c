Yes, both the child and parent can access the file, even if it was opened before the fork statement.

> What happens when they are written to the file concurrently?

There doesn't appear to be any conflicts. The parent process appears to do its write operation first before the child.

It should be noted that the processes are *adding* to the file. If they were rewriting it, then there is potential for shenanigans, as it is later demonstrated in the project.
