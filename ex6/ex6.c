// Write a program that will find the average time it takes for your computer
// to make a system call an empty write to stdout. Your program should use the 
// `clock_gettime` procedure to time how long a single system call takes. It'll 
// do this for one million iterations, and then find the average of all of those 
// iterations in nanoseconds.
// For some helpful documentation and examples of using time-related system calls,
// visit this site: https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/c-tutorials/gettime.html
